building binaries for tlptexlive
--------------------------------

patches are from various people, if I have
not forgotten anyone:
  Kitagawa-san
  Tanaka-san
  Kakuto-san

Please configure in the script
  build-ptexlive-binaries
the first few lines, or set one of the 
following env variables:
  BUILD_SOURCE
    the directory where the sources are saved to
    does not need to exist
  BUILD_TARGET
    where the resulting zip file of binaries is places
  BUILD_PATCHES
    the location of this file and the patches
  BUILD_VERBOSE
    if you run rsync, this is passed as additional arg
  BUILD_NORSYNC
    do not rsync, assume already up2date source
    (I use this to build in my svn checkout)
  BUILD_MAKEFLAGS
    additional flags passed to make, for example -j2 for dual core processors
Then run
  bash build-ptexlive-binaries
and send me the generated binaries.zip

For Apple MacOSX, you can run the script with
  bash build-ptexlive-binaries --macosx
to get (hopefully) working compilation (code thanks to Munehiro Yamamoto).
